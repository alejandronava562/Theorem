Geometry:
Lesson 1: Points Lines and Planes and stuff
Have them learn about the basis of geometry and the exercises will we T or F
Lesson 2: Angles
Have them learn about acute straight obtuse and stuff and the exercises will be for them to identify what is each one
Lesson 3: Triangles Pt. 1
Teach them types of triangles, and the exercises will be identifying them
Lesson 4: Triangles Pt. 2
We will teach them the formulas such as Pythagorean Theorem or triangular inequality and the exercises will be for them to solve questions using those formulas
Lesson 5: Quadrilaterals and Polygons
We can teach them stuff like squares and the exercises will be to name the polygons
Lesson 6: Circles Pt. 1
We teach them about circles and what is a circle and what isn’t and the problems would be to identify what is and what isn't
Lesson 7: Circle Pt. 2
We teach them about the formulas such as the ones for radius, diameter, circumference, chords, arcs, and central/inscribed angles and the problems would be to let them solve using the formulas
Lesson 8: Perimeter, Area, and Volume
Teach them all the formulas (this lesson could be broken into smaller pieces)
Lesson 9: Unit Review
